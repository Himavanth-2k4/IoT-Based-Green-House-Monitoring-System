# IoT-based Greenhouse Monitoring System

This project is a **C++ simulation** of an IoT-based greenhouse monitoring system. 
It includes virtual sensors and actuators to monitor and regulate temperature, humidity, and soil moisture levels, simulating real-world greenhouse automation.

## Features
- **Sensors**:
  - Temperature Sensor
  - Humidity Sensor
  - Soil Moisture Sensor
- **Actuators**:
  - Fan for temperature control
  - Sprinkler for humidity regulation
  - Pump for irrigation
- **Event Logging**:
  - Captures sensor readings and actions taken during each 10-minute interval.
  - Provides a detailed event log for the entire day.
- **Dynamic Settings**:
  - Allows modification of greenhouse temperature and humidity ranges.
- **Soil-based Plant Recommendations**:
  - Suggests suitable plants based on the selected soil type (Loamy, Sandy, Clay, Silt).
- **Hardware Status Check**:
  - Simulates a status check for all sensors and actuators.

## Prerequisites
- **Compiler**: A C++17 or newer compatible compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
- **Environment**: Any platform that supports standard C++ libraries.
